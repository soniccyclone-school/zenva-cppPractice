# Zenva C++ Programming for Beginners

Just a repository for the code I wrote while following along with Zenva's [C++ Programming for Beginners](https://academy.zenva.com/course/c-for-beginners/).

I am including the .vscode folder as I want this to serve as a complete example of the setup I went through to get C++ running in vscode. [This](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp) is the documentation I had to use to get C++ working in vscode.
